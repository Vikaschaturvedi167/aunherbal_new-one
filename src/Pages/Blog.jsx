            <h1>MENSTURAL HYGIENE:</h1>
            <p>
              Menstrual hygiene is something that many women don’t think about
              or consider, but it’s an important part of staying healthy and
              comfortable during your period. Knowing what to do and what not to
              do when it comes to menstrual hygiene can help you have a safer
              and more comfortable menstrual experience. The first thing to
              remember about menstrual hygiene is that it’s important to keep
              your genitals clean. While you may not feel like taking a shower
              every day during your period, it’s still important to clean the
              area with warm water and mild soap. This helps to reduce bacteria
              and odor during your cycle. It’s also important to change your pad
              or tampon regularly, even if you don’t feel like you need to do
              so. This helps to keep the area free of germs and bacteria that
              could cause infection. When it comes to menstrual products, it’s
              important to choose the right ones for your needs. Pads and
              tampons come in different sizes and absorbencies, so make sure you
              choose one that fits you well and provides enough protection for
              your flow. You should also make sure to check the expiration date
              on pads and tampons before using them, as they can become less
              effective over time. Additionally, it’s important to use only one
              type of menstrual product at a time, as using multiple can
              increase the risk of yeast infections or irritation. It’s also
              important to take care of your menstrual cup, if you choose to use
              one. Be sure to wash your cup with mild soap and water after each
              use, and wash your hands well before and after inserting or
              removing your cup. Additionally, be sure to empty, rinse, and
              re-insert your cup after 12 hours of wear. Doing this will help
              reduce the risk of infection. Finally, it’s important not to
              douche or use any scented products near the genitals during your
              period. Doing so can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in
              the vagina and increase the risk of infection. Additionally, be
              sure to avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing during your period,
              as this can trap moisture close to the skin and increase the risk
              of bacteria growth. It’s also important to avoid using heavily
              scented bubble baths or body washes during your cycle as these can
              also disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina. By
              following these simple tips for menstrual hygiene, you can help
              ensure that you have a safe and comfortable period each month.
              Remember that taking care of yourself during menstruation is just
              as important as taking care of yourself during any other time of
              the month - so make sure you practice good menstrual hygiene
              habits!

            Greek medicine, the combination of the right diet with proper
            seasoning is also essential for good digestion. Avoid more fat,
            fried, and spicy foods during meals, and instead, consume healthy
            and easily digestible foods like spinach, bottle gourd, and lentils.
            Yoga and meditation can also be helpful in reducing stomach problems
            as they help reduce physical and mental stress. Greek medicine has

            ginger, mint, carom seeds, and fennel. Regular use of these remedies
            improves the digestion process and can alleviate stomach-related
            problems. However, note that these treatments are only for common
            problems, and it is advisable to consult a doctor for serious
            problems. In this way, Greek medicine uses various ancient remedies
            to improve stomach problems during menstruation. These remedies can
            help alleviate stomach problems and make you feel healthy and
            comfortable.
